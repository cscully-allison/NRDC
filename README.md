# Nevada Research Data Center Android QA App

The Nevada Research Data Center (NRDC) Android QA App is an application for the Android mobile platform. It is intended to be used by technicians of the Solar Energy-Water-Environment Nexus project who are working on thirteen remote research sites across Nevada to gather varied climate data. The application is design to enable the technicians to add information and service-related entries about these research sites during their trip to site locations. This in turn will provide a convenient transfer of data between techniciansand the NRDC's database.
